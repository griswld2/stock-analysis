# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to analyze the return on a list of green stocks by refactoring code and making the pre-existing code more efficient to run. 

## Results
The performances of the various stocks were inconsistent YoY. Only two different stocks (ENPH and RUN) showed positive returns in both 2017 and 2018. Based off the analysis of stocks, I would not recommend an investment strategy of buying single stocks. Instead, I would focus on building up an investment portfolio that is diverse and would protect any individual investor from the ebbs and flows of the market.

## Summary

### Refactoring Code
The refactored code ran in less than one second for both the 2017 and 2018 results. This is much more efficient than the previously written code which took greater than two seconds. 

The benefits of refactoring code is that it allows our code to run more efficiently. This helps out from a work productivity stand point by allowing us to run additional scripts while also helping us out from a resources perspective as well when running script. Additional advantages of refactoring code is that it allows us to edit our code to be more D.R.Y. 

The original script was useful in that it allowed us to go over a handful of stocks. This new script is more useful in that it can handle a larger amount of data and stocks while running more efficiently.
